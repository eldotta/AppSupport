# MyTimelines - Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** Feb 7, 2026

**MyTimelines** respects your privacy. This app is designed to work primarily on your device and does not collect or track personal information.

## Information We Collect

MyTimelines does not collect personal data, usage analytics, tracking information, or identifiers.

All content you create in the app — including timeline events, descriptions, photos, and people you manually add — is created and stored by you on your device.

People added to events are user-defined entries within the app. MyTimelines does not access your contacts or address book.

## Data Storage

All timeline data is stored locally on your device.

If you choose to enable iCloud synchronization, your data is also stored in your iCloud account and synced using Apple’s iCloud services. iCloud sync is optional and can be enabled or disabled at any time. Apple manages iCloud data according to its own privacy policies.

MyTimelines does not operate servers and does not store user data outside your device or iCloud.

## Data Sharing

MyTimelines does not sell, share, or transfer your data to third parties.

The app does not use advertising services, analytics SDKs, or third-party tracking technologies.

## User Control

You control your data at all times. You can edit or delete events at any time within the app.

All data is stored locally on your device. If iCloud synchronization is enabled, data is also stored in your iCloud account and managed by Apple. Deleting the app removes the local app data but may not immediately remove data stored in iCloud. iCloud data can be managed or deleted using Apple’s iCloud settings.

## Children’s Privacy

MyTimelines is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated if app features change. Any updates will be reflected on this page.
